Introduction
This project was originally created by former TA Alan Yao (now at AirBNB).
It is a web mapping application inspired by Alan’s time on the Google Maps
team and the OpenStreetMap project, from which the tile images and map feature
data was downloaded. You are working with real-world mapping data here that is
freely available - after you’ve finished this project, you can even extend your c
ode to support a wider range of features. You will be writing the back end - the
web server that powers the API that the front end makes requests to. The project
3 video playlist starts with an introductory video that should help you get started.

This project is a solo project. You should not work with a partner. One of our biggest
goals for 61B is to develop your independence as a programmer, and this project is a
great milestone for you to complete on your own before you go on to bigger and better things.
